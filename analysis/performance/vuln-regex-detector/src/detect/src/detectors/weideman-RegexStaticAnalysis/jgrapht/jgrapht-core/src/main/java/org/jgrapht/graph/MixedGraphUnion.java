 * MixedGraphUnion.java
 * -------------------------
 *
 * This class implements a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixed_graph">Mixed-Graph</a>. A Mixed-Graph consists of
 * both undirected edges, and directed arcs. The mixed graph is obtained by taking the union of a undirected and a directed graph.
 * Be careful: NOT all algorithm implementations in the JgraphT handle Mixed Graphs correctly, so thoroughly check the results! From the outside, a Mixed-Graph is a
 * DirectedGraph. However, the undirected edges should obviously be treated as undirected. Many algorithms have a switch checking whether the graph is Directed or Undirected, and behave
 * differently uppon the result; these algorithms do not necessarily handle hybrid cases like this correctly. An example algorithm which *does* handle the Mixed-Graphs correctly
 * is the FloydWarshallShortestPath implementation.
 *
 * Often, a Mixed-Graph is unnecessary: every undirected edge (i,j) can be replaced by two directed arcs: <i,j>,<j,i>, thereby obtaining a Directed Graph. This is the
 * preferred approach since all algorithm implementations work well for Directed Graphs. However, there are use-cases where a pair of directed arcs <i,j>,<j,i> have a different
 * meaning than a single undirected edge (i,j). In the latter case, this class is applicable.
