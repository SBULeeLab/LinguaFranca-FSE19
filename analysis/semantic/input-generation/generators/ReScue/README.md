This is a snapshot of my [fork (0a629ac)](https://github.com/davisjam/ReScue/tree/InputGeneration) of Shen et al.'s [ReScue project](https://2bdenny.github.io/ReScue/) ([paper](https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3238159)).

In my fork, I modified the tool to emit the strings it tries while searching for expensive inputs. We use these strings as inputs in our experiments.
