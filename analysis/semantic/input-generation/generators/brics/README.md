This is a snapshot of the mutrex.jar file from my [fork](https://github.com/davisjam/dk.brics.automaton/tree/RandomStringGenerator) of Moeller's [Brics project](https://www.brics.dk/automaton/).

In my fork, I modified the tool to produce inputs randomly, not systematically, so that I could sample its inputs in my experiments.
