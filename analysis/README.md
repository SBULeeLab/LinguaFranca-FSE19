## Structure of the analyses

The analyses in this paper are embarrassingly parallel.
Each analysis can be performed on a single regex (or a group of regexes) independent of analyses on the others.

As a result, we performed our experiments on a compute cluster.
We therefore divided each analysis into two parts:
1. `test-for-X.py`: Test for the property in question and produce a data file (distribute the work across the cluster)
2. `analyze-X.py`: Analyze a combined set of results (after merging the compute job)
